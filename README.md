# House-Prediction-Problem-in-python
This project predicts the Housing Price based on 80 features and is developed using Linear Regression in Machine Learning

DATASET DESCRIPTION:
DataSet Link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

train.csv - the training set

test.csv - the test set

data_description.txt - full description of each column, originally prepared by Dean De Cock but lightly edited to match the column names used here

FOR FILE model training done step by step:
This file depicts the Linear Regression using Gradient descent for 2000 iterations and keep the learning rate = 0.07 gives best redsult.

FOR FILE model using sklearn:
In this file the traing of model is done using the function of sklearn i.e. sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()

Just download the .ipynb file for step by step traing of model as well as for predicting on given inputs.

requirements.txt file contains all the required libraries to run the python script's codes.
